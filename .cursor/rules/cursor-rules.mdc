# Cursor Rules Authoring Standard

This file defines how **all Cursor rules (.mdc)** must be created, structured and maintained in this project.

Cursor must follow this rule when generating, updating or extending any rule file.

---

## 1. Rule location

All rules must be created inside:

```

.cursor/rules/

```

Rules must never be created:
- In the project root
- In subfolders outside `.cursor/rules`
- Inside `src/`, `docs/` or any application folder

---

## 2. File naming

All rule files must:

- Use **kebab-case**
- Be **descriptive**
- End with **.mdc**

Examples:
```

ui-design-system.mdc
state-and-data.mdc
routing-and-pages.mdc
testing-strategy.mdc
performance-guidelines.mdc

```

Bad examples:
```

rules.mdc
config.mdc
stuff.mdc
uiRules.txt

```

---

## 3. One responsibility per rule

Each rule file must cover **only one domain**.

Allowed domains:
- Project identity
- Stack & tooling
- Architecture
- UI & design system
- State & data
- Routing & pages
- Testing
- Performance
- Security
- Code style & quality

A rule must **never** mix multiple domains.

Example:
- UI rules must not include API rules
- State rules must not include router rules

---

## 4. Rule header (YAML frontmatter)

Every rule file must start with:

```

---

description: Short, clear explanation of what this rule controls
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---

```

Rules:
- `description` is mandatory
- `globs` is optional and only used when the rule targets specific files
- `alwaysApply` must be `false` unless the rule is truly global

Only meta-rules (like this one) may use `alwaysApply: true`.

---

## 5. Rule structure

Every rule must follow this structure:

```

---

description: ...
globs: ...
alwaysApply: false
------------------

# Rule Title

Short explanation of the domain this rule controls.

## Core Principles

High-level non-negotiable rules.

## Mandatory Rules

Things Cursor must always follow.

## Forbidden Patterns

Things Cursor must never do.

## Examples

Good and bad examples when relevant.

```

---

## 6. Writing style

All rules must be written in:
- **Clear, direct, imperative language**
- No vague suggestions
- No “try to”, “should if possible”, or “it might be good”

Use:
- “Must”
- “Must not”
- “Always”
- “Never”

---

## 7. How Cursor must generate new rules

When creating a new rule, Cursor must:

1. Identify the domain (UI, state, routing, etc)
2. Create a new `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`
3. Use the naming rules
4. Use the required frontmatter
5. Follow the standard structure
6. Keep the scope strictly limited to that domain

Cursor must never:
- Add rules to an existing file if the domain is different
- Merge multiple domains into one file
- Create a generic “misc” rule

---

## 8. Rule conflicts

If two rules conflict:
- The **more specific rule wins**
- The rule with **globs** wins over a generic one
- Domain rules override global rules

Cursor must respect this hierarchy when applying rules.

---

## 9. This rule is authoritative

This file is the **source of truth** for how Cursor rules are written in this project.

Any rule that violates this standard must be rewritten to conform to it.
